2 problems 

1  with counting the numbers with certain number of reptitions inside a stream that we dont know its length

for example 

countreps(5,3, "5564555556555")

this should return 2 

i solved this one in 10 or 13 mins

the second one was an interval map problem with colors red, yello, blue

he provided a class with get method and wants me to implement the set method and take care of the override behavior of the last set operation on the line number
